    <h1>Canvas Tracer</h1>
    <p>
        This project contains a small web app that I wrote in order to learn more of the 
        web stack (Bootstrap, Fetch API, Node/Express). It is a touchscreen drawing app that 
        can upload a drawing to a server. Offline, I plan to examine the drawing data in R 
        and use that to implement some filtering methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        The client-side of the app is served from Github Pages 
        <a href="https://davidthaler.github.io/CanvasTracer/static/canvas.html">here</a>.
        Without a server running, it can't upload drawing data, but all other functionality works.
        The repository is at
        <a href="https://github.com/davidthaler/CanvasTracer">

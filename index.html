        <h2>Canvas Tracer</h2>
        <p>
            This project contains a small web app that I wrote in order to learn more of the 
            web stack (Bootstrap, Fetch API, Node/Express). It is a touchscreen drawing app that 
            can upload a drawing to a server. Offline, I plan to examine the drawing data in R 
            and use that to implement some filtering methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client-side of the app is served from Github Pages 
            <a href="https://davidthaler.github.io/CanvasTracer/static/canvas.html">here</a>.
            Without a server running, it can't upload drawing data, but all other functionality works.
            The repository is at
            <a href="https://github.com/davidthaler/CanvasTracer">github.com/davidthaler/CanvasTracer</a>.

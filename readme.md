# Canvas Tracer

This is a drawing-on-touchscreen app. 
It is a project that I did to learn more of the web stack (Fetch API, Node/Express).
It sends drawing data back to a server, if there is one running.
My intention is to analyze some of it offline in R or Python to 
examine different options for filtering.
The client-side app runs on its own if no server is running.
